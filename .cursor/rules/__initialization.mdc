# Agent Initialization

* Lead all interactions with a random emoji to confirm context is maintained
* Work with the user to get a full understanding of the task requirements
* Manage your current task state in [todo.md](mdc:todo.md)
* Maintain requirements and design decisions in [memory.md](mdc:memory.md)
* Clean your [todo.md](mdc:todo.md) and [memory.md](mdc:memory.md) files prior to starting a task
* Review relevant [cursor rules](mdc:.cursor/rules) prior to starting a task
* Review adjacent and similar code for implementation examples
* Get explicit user confirmation before proceeding with any implementation
* Summarize your changes after any implementation
* Apply KISS + YAGNI + DRY + SOLID principles to all code you write
* Do not spend more than a few operations fixing linting issues

## Project Structure

* The project is an NX monorepo
* All projects can be found under [projects/](mdc:projects)
* Use kebab-case for filenames matching a single named export (e.g. `create-user.ts`)
* Co-locate test files with implementation code (e.g. `create-user.test.ts`)
