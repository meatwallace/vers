# Package Management Standards

* Use `yarn` to execute repository commands
* Commands must be executed from the repository root
* Project specific scripts are available i.e. `yarn dev:app-web`
* All available scripts are viewable in the root [package.json](mdc:package.json) 

## Common Commands

* typecheck - `yarn typecheck`
* test - `yarn test:<project-name>`
* lint - `yarn lint`
* format - `yarn format`
