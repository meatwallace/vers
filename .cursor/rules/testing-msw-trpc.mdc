# TRPC MSW Mock Standards

Example code: [create-password-reset-token.ts](mdc:projects/service-api/src/mocks/handlers/service-user/create-password-reset-token.ts)

* Import types from `@vers/service-types` for payload shapes
* Implement similar, simplified logic to the real handler
* Use MSW database for state management
* Return `TRPCError`s as needed
* Mirror production database constraints
