# Cursor Rule Standards

* Place all rule files in [.cursor/rules](mdc:.cursor/rules)
* Write clear, actionable standards
* Group related standards under numbered sections
* Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
* Always use language-specific code blocks (e.g. ```tsx)
* Keep examples focused and minimal
* Only include good examples with explanatory comments
