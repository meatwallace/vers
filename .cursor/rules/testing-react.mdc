# React Testing Standards

Example Code: [status-button.test.tsx](mdc:projects/app-web/app/components/status-button.test.tsx)

* Create type-safe test setup functions that return common utilities
* Reset mocks & state as needed in `afterEach` 
* Use `screen` queries over container queries
* Prefer role-based queries (getByRole)
* Fall back to text-based queries (getByText)
* Avoid testid-based queries unless necessary
* Use proper aria roles and labels
* Always assign React Testing Library queries to variables before assertions
* Never chain queries directly into assertions
* Use `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event` for interactions
