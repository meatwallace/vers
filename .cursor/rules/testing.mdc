# Universal Testing Standards

* NEVER use code mocks (`vi.mock`) unless explicitly instructed by the user
* ALWAYS prefer testing real code rather than mocked code (MSW for network requests excluded)
* Use Vitest's `test` fn, do not use `describe` blocks
* Prioritize a happy path test, following by edge cases
* Logically follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
* Keep tests focused and atomic
* Avoid implementation details in the test name

Good test cases:

* "it redirects to the login route"
* "it shows an error when verification fails"
