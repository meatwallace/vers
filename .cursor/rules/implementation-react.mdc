# React Component Structure Standards

Example code:

* React Router route - [route.tsx](mdc:projects/app-web/app/routes/dashboard/route.tsx)
* Component - [status-button.tsx](mdc:projects/app-web/app/components/status-button.tsx)

## Component Structure

* Use functional components with explicit return types
* Export component states/enums as static properties

## Props

* Prefix boolean props with auxiliary verbs (is/has/should)
* Use handler prefix for callbacks (on/handle)
* Access props via property access, not destructuring

## Component Patterns

* Use enums rather than string literals where possible (i.e. `Route.Signup`)
* Use React Router's `Link` component for internal URLs

## Route Components

* DO NOT manually create `Route` types from the `+types` directory -
  they will be automatically generated by React Router.
