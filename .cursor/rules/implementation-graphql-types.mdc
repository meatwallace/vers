# GraphQL Type Implementation Standards

Example code: [user.ts](mdc:projects/service-api/src/schema/types/user.ts)

## Type Categories

Types are broken into 3 distinct categories:

1. Domain Entities - core business objects, primarily representing database objects
2. Response Payloads - operation-specific response types
3. Utility Types - generic reusable types i.e. `MutationError`

## Documentation

* All types must have JSDoc documentation
* Document the type itself using `@description`
* Document relationships using `@see`
