# GraphQL MSW Mock Standards

Example code: [finish-login-with-2fa.ts](mdc:projects/app-web/app/mocks/handlers/gql/finish-login-with-2fa.ts)

* Define explicit `_Variable` and `_Response` interfaces using generated GraphQL types
* Implement similar, simplified logic to the real handler
* Use `HttpResponse.json()` for consistent response formatting
* Use MSW database for state management
* Handle all error cases explicitly
* Mirror production database constraints
