# GraphQL Types Standards

Generated schema: [schema.graphql](mdc:schema.graphql)
Generated client types: [graphql.ts](mdc:projects/app-web/app/gql/graphql.ts)

* GraphQL TypeScript types are generated by `graphql-codegen`
* Run `yarn codegen:graphql` to generate
* Reference generated types in components and services
* Re-run generation after schema changes
