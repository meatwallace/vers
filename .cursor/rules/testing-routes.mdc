# React Router Testing Standards

Example code: [route.test.tsx](mdc:projects/app-web/app/routes/verify-otp/route.test.tsx)

* Use `createRoutesStub` for router configuration
* Use [with-authed-user.ts](mdc:projects/app-web/app/test-utils/with-authed-user.ts) and [with-session.ts](mdc:projects/app-web/app/test-utils/with-session.ts) wrappers to add session or user state as needed
* Write integration style tests in the style of our [testing-react.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing-react.mdc) best practices
* Assert session state as needed to verify side effects
